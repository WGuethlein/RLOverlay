# Rocket League Overlay

## Overview

This project is a broadcast overlay for Rocket League built using Vite + React. It grabs data from the SOS Overlay plugin, written for the BakkesMod addition. Data from the game comes in from a websocket provided by SOS. This project is also my first completed react project, built to showcase my progress as a beginner in the Web Dev field. Over time it will evolve with me.
